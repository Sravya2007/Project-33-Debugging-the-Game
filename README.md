# Angry Birds Game

## A similar model of the original angry birds game
Yes, it has been made with matter.js and p5.js.

## How do I play the game?
An unlikely question to ask, but for those who don't know- Drag the bird and release it to shoot the pigs who are sitting in the wooden structure.

## How do I get another chance to shoot the pigs?
Press the space key for another chance.

## What is the maximum score I can get?
You can get upto 400 points by shooting both the pigs.

## How does the game end?
If you get a maximum score of 400 or if your bird goes out of the screen, you don't get another chance to shoot the pigs, so you have to reload the game alotgether.

# Thank you for playing this game, I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š
